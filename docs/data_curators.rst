Data entry
==========
Current POC data model has the concept of an AnimalEncounter, during which
different kinds of observations are made. The kind of observations depend
on the species and health/behaviour of the animal - e.g. "dead and not doing much else"
is a Stranding Observation (morphometrics, tags, photos, damage, disposal, biopsy,
necropsy), while "alive and nesting" is a Tagging Observation (morphometrics,
tags, photos, damage, nest, eggs).


The following sections will

* link to example data sheets of all supported formats, and
* for each format, map the fields of the paper form to the online form.


Turtle Strandings
-----------------
So much documentation coming here really soon!

Cetacean Strandings
-------------------
The data currently lives in another departmental Strandings database.

Turtle Tagging
--------------
The data currently lives in WAMTRAM 2.

Tag returns
-----------
When TOs harvest and eat a tagged turtle, they return the
tags to the Department.

Turtle Tracks
-------------
Track count is captured by the Ningaloo Turtle Program's
Access database.


Data QA
=======
Talking points:

* Proofreading: compare data sheets to entered data
* Subject matter experts: making sense of the data (and determining which data don't)


Data release
============
Marking data as "publication ready"
