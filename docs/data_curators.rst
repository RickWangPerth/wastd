Data entry
==========
Current POC data model has the concept of an AnimalEncounter, during which
different kinds of observations are made. The kind of observations depend
on the species and health/behaviour of the animal - e.g. "dead and not doing much else"
is a Stranding Observation (morphometrics, tags, photos, damage, disposal, biopsy,
necropsy), while "alive and nesting" is a Tagging Observation (morphometrics,
tags, photos, damage, nest, eggs).


The following sections will

* link to example data sheets of all supported formats, and
* for each format, map the fields of the paper form to the online form.


Turtle Strandings
-----------------
For each data entry, first convert all files to PDF, images, or plain txt:

* Emails saved as msg: open with Outlook, save as ".txt".
* Paper forms: scan to PDF, make sure the quality is readable enough.
* Images: jpg, png are preferred.
* Photos embedded in MS Word documents: save as jpg or png.
* MS Word documents: save as PDF.

All formats must be non-proprietary.

Then, `create a new AnimalEncounter <https://strandings-test.dpaw.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/animalencounter/add/>`_.

* Observed at: if coordinates are given, click anywhere on map and enter given
  coordinates into the text field underneath the map widget.
* Observer, reporter: click on the search icon; add observer / reporter as new
  user if they are not registered in the system. Update their details from the
  user list with full names and email addresses, then re-save encounter.

Cetacean Strandings
-------------------
The data currently lives in another departmental Strandings database.

Turtle Tagging
--------------
The data currently lives in WAMTRAM 2.

Tag returns
-----------
When TOs harvest and eat a tagged turtle, they return the
tags to the Department.

Turtle Tracks
-------------
Track count is captured by the Ningaloo Turtle Program's
Access database.


Data QA
=======
Talking points:

* Proofreading: compare data sheets to entered data
* Subject matter experts: making sense of the data (and determining which data don't)


Data release
============
Marking data as "publication ready"
