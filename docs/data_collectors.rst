Data collectors
===============

Each field in the data sheets should be questioned:

* Is this information used in any of the analytical outputs?
* Does this information serve any QA purpose?
* Is this information used to derive other information, e.g. deformities being
  used to identify an animal identity?
* Will anyone in the future require this information?

Turtle Stranding
================

Improve data sheet:

Photo guidelines
----------------
If possible, take pictures of the stranded animal:

* Totals: the whole animal from above,  from each side, from the front and the back.
  Include a length reference, such as a shoe, or an object of known lengh.
* Details: Every flipper tag, every visible damage, notable details (fresh and healed
  injuries, deformities)
* Location: the surroundings showing about 20 meters or more to show beach position
  (relative to high water line, edge of vegetation) and location (so that we can
  find the location on Google Maps).
