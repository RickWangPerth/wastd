******************
Third party access
******************

If you are DBCA staff and not yet signed in, or if you are an external user, 
visiting WAStD will redirect you to the DBCA Auth2 page to authenticate through DBCA Microsoft 365
or sign up using a Microsoft account, Google, or an arbitrary email.

On first login, you will land on the "Permission denied" page. 
Your access attempt will be logged and we will be in touch once your permissions have been assigned. 
Once permissions have been assigned, you can login again and will get to the WAStD home page.

Logins are valid for a day. Once a login has expired, you will need to login again.

Data viewers will be able to view all data, but not edit it.

Data curators will be able to access the data curation and QA portal.

Data analysts can find instructions how to access and authenticate against the API on their profile page.

More fine-grained permission management will be added as the need arises.
