Data collection administrators
==============================

This chapter provides all required knowledge for data collection admins.
The admins form a bridge between the ODK data maintainer (Florian Mayer)
and the data collectors (staff and volunteers).

Tasks covered:

* Getting started
* Set up tablets
* Provide training
* Prepare tablets for data collection
* Receive tablets after data collection

Quick notes
-----------
* It's worth to bring each tablet to WiFi or a phone hotspot after each data capture day. If that's not possible, it's worth downloading each tablet's data onto a laptop each day. (e.g. at Bungelup camp).
* It's unadvisable to send out tablets with unsubmitted data to a new data capture campaign.
* It's worth to replace any tablet with signs of impending hardware failure such as cracked screens, bulging batteries, or unusually long start-up times with a fresh tablet. The hardware failure rate depends highly on how devices are treated by end users (100% loss in some places where tablets are transported unprotected in a backpack together with hammers and metal stakes - unsurprisingly - to 2 out of 20 tablets lost over 3 years at Ningaloo)
* It's worth to have two fully set up spare devices ready to go and procure a new device immediately each time an old one is retired.


Admin: Getting started
======================
* Admin's computer: set Chrome or Firefox as default browser
* Bookmark TSC

Admin: Prepare field packs
==========================
For each team collecting data at the same time:

* One neoprene pouch containing:
* Two data collection tablets
* Two Micro USB cables to charge tablets
* One power bank (mobile battery) 20000mAh
* One wooden folding ruler with turtle track widths (min and max) marked in coloured tape
* One whiteboard
* One whiteboard marker
* Turtle track ID guide
* Predator track ID guide

Admin: Create offline background imagery
========================================
* Use latest QGIS (3.18 or higher)
* Areas: Save `WAStD Areas <https://wastd.dbca.wa.gov.au/api/1/area/?area_type=Site&format=json&limit=1000>`_ as areas.geojson, drag and drop into QGIS
* Add ArcGIS Map Service as title "ESRI World Imagery" and with URL
  https://server.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer
* Add "High Resolution 30cm imagery" and zoom to target location (e.g. Thevenard Island)
* Change Project CRS to WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
* Open QGIS Processing Toolbox > Raster tools > Generate XYZ tiles (MBTiles)
* Run with settings:
  * Extent: draw on map
  * DPI 96
  * Zoom max 20, min 5. Figure out max zoom vs max avail zoom of ESRI imagery.
  * Format png
  * save to file (e.g. THV.mbtiles) with extension ``.mbtiles``
* Repeat for each program's location and distribute resulting files to local coordinators.

Admin: First time setup
=======================

These steps have to be run once per new tablet.
They are the minimum steps to provide a production ready data collection tablet.

Setup the tablet - first time
-----------------------------
This protocol should be followed before a tablet is taken out into the field when set up fresh.

* Start fully charged, plug into charger to lengthen screen timeout
* Language: English / Australia
* Check out some info to get started: select all
* Wifi: do not use DBCA's Wongi, use guest.dbca.wa.gov.au.
* Checking for updates: wait out.
* Copy apps and data: don't.
* Sign into a work-only Google account - all tablets handed out from turtle program are linked to wa.turtles@gmail.com.
  If you are not Florian Mayer, use your own work-only Google account.
* Google assistant: no thanks
* Google services: untick "help improve..." options. Keep "Back up apps etc" and "Location services" option.
* Skip screen lock.
* Skip creating a Lenovo/Samsung account. The "Start using your new device" button is hidden under the keyboard. Press "Back" to minimize keyboard.
* Update Android apps if prompted and address any notifications.

Device settings:

* General Management > Date & time: Set time zone to AWST (GMT+08), 24 hour format, auto time and timezone from network.
* General Management > Keyboard: auto replace off, font size larger, keyboard size large.
* Display: set screen timeout to 2 minutes.
* Security: do not configure any screen lock (leave as is).
* Keyboard: Whenever the keyboard is open, tap the settings cogwheel and resize it at the uper edge to be as large as possible. Increase font size too.
* General Management > About Tablet: update device name to shortcode (e.g. NTP01), get serial number for the tablet register `<https://dbcawa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TG/pages/896827488/Tablet+register>`_.

App settings:

* Camera: Open app, enable location tags, so that all photos are geo-referenced with
  the coordinates they were taken at. This turns the camera into a generic
  data collection form (image, time, location).
* Google Photos: open app, settings, auto-backup all photos in "high quality" (about 2MP) to Google Photos.

Setup the tablet after a season
-------------------------------
This section is for administrators updating tablets for a new field season.

* Fully charge tablets
* Turn on tablets, apply all available system updates:
  * Settings > Display > Font size and style: set to 5 of 8; timeout: 2 minutes
  * Settings > General Management > Date and time: automatic date and time, time zone GMT+08 (Perth), 24 hour format
  * Settings > Software update > Check for updates, download and install (or follow notifications).
  * There can be multiple big (>1GB, new Android version) and smaller (~200MB security patches) updates. Repeat until latest versions.
* Google Play: update all apps, ODK Collect first.
* Scan new QR code as and when instructed.
* Delete and re-create all home screen widgets. (Could be safe to keep in 2021, pending testing)


Setup the tablet - before field season
--------------------------------------
This protocol should be followed before a tablet is taken out into the field when coming out of storage.

* Charge fully, turn on.
* Settings > System update > check for update > install if any available. Repeat until up to date.
* Google Play > My apps > Update all.

Admin: Prepare a length reference pre survey
--------------------------------------------
For situations where the data collector is unsure of the turtle species causing a given turtle track,
the data collection form offers to take a picture of the track for later review and species identification.
Having a length reference in the photos helps the reviewer immensely with species identification.

A simple and cheap length reference for tricky turtle tracks
can be fabricated from a  foldable wooden rule (2m folding into 20cm segments),
marked with goloured duct tape ($5 per roll) at the minimum and maximum track width
for each turtle species expected to occur in the surveyed area.

Tomato stick prototype:

.. image:: https://photos.app.goo.gl/lc6kjZMTrPlpjCoG3
    :target: https://photos.app.goo.gl/lc6kjZMTrPlpjCoG3
    :alt: Turtle track length reference

The reference can be simplified, e.g. if only green and flatback turtles are expected,
a stick can be cut to the maximum flatback track width, with one marking for the
minimum green track width.

Additional length markings, e.g. intervals of 10cm, can be added as required.

This method is preferred over the use of a measuring tape as length reference in
photos of tracks of unknown species for the following reasons:

* A rigid rule will lay on top of sand ripples,
  while measuring tape will distort measurement by bending over them.
* The coloured, centimeter-wide markings on the rule will be visible at lower image quality
  than the millimeter-wide centimeter markings on a measuring tape.
* The coloured tape wraps around the rule and is thereby visible from any angle,
  while tape can flip over and hide its markings.
* By reducing length references to relevant lengths, cognitive load is taken off the data collector.
  One can simply read off the markings which species' track width range a given track falls into.

Prepare one length reference per data collection team.

Setup ODK Collect from QR code
------------------------------
Open ODK Collect.

* Settings (three dots top right) > Configure via QR code
  (if asked, grant ODK Collect required permissions to access camera)
* Update the username to a real name, e.g. "Florian Mayer".
  Initially, use the coordintator's (your) name.
* Set camera to medium / 2048px
* set guidance to yes - collapsed

Distribute offline background imagery
-------------------------------------
* You will be provided the background imagery files (extension ``.mbtiles``).
* Connect each tablet via USB, unlock screen, confirm dialogue to allow file transfer on tablet.
* Copy the mbtiles files into ``/Android/data/org.odk.collect.android/file/projects/<project hash>/layers`` on each tablet.
* You can provide multiple mbtiles. Mind available disk space (16GB ish) vs mbtiles size
  (200-500MB each) vs storage for ODK records including media files (photos).
* Open ODK Collect, Fill blank form, hit any map symbol next to the forms, tap the layers button,
  select the correct reference layer (named after your location).

Providing training
==================
Run all data collectors through the chapter "Data collection training" until they
are competent and comfortable with the hardware and software.

Training day: mixed real and duplicated training data
=====================================================
Sometimes, training and production surveys coincide.
One tablet captures real data, multiple other tablets capture the same data in duplicate.
Enumerators must train real data capture, but afterwards we want to be able to delete duplicates.

The data capture coordinator must follow these steps:

* Let users enter their full name as ODK Collect Username
* Trainer: Take all but one tablet, update username to "Training"
* Capture data as if it's all production. This creates duplicate Surveys and Encounters.
* Let the data upload, and wait out the daily import to WAStD.
* Find Surveys and Encounters, mark as "training" / "hatchback" / "not production" and curate.

Collector: Collect data
=======================
Under normal circumstances, the data collector will head out into the field and collect data following
the protocols from the "Data collection training" chapter.
The admin should be intimately acquainted with this chapter.

Admin: Review data
==================
**Note** In 2018, we have configured ODK Collect to never leave forms unfinalized,
so this section applies up to season 2017-18.

"Edit Saved Form" lists all unfinalized forms pending review and species / nest ID:

* Tap once to view read-only, tap again to edit
* review and update data (e.g. species ID)
* mark as finalized and save.

Delete unwanted repeating groups:

* Tap and hold a group title bar, select "delete".

If GPS point is missing, record GPS (which will be incorrect), note record datetime and other details, let form upload,
let data import into WAStD, find record again (based on datetime and details), update location as appropriate.
Mark record as "proofread".

Admin: Upload data
==================
When surveys are done in locations where the device can return to the comforts
of WiFi and power points daily, data can be uploaded directly to ODK Central.

* Settings: the correct username and password have been configured during device setup.
* Turn on the WiFi hotspot or move into WiFi range.
* Turn on the device's WiFi.

With "Auto-send in WiFi" settings enabled, the device will automatically upload
all data marked as "finalized".
This will leave all non-finalised forms requiring review in "Edit Saved Forms".
Review each form and "save as finalized".

When WiFi is not available daily, the admin needs to backup data by downloading
it manually and keeping the downloaded data safe (multiple copies over separate
storage media). With the mobile device connected and "MTP file transfer" enabled,
ODK data is located in internal storage in ``odk/instances``.
Each form will be stored in a separate folder, containing both the filled in form
as XML file, and all related pictures and media.

Simplest backup: periodically take a copy of ``odk/instances``.
If data upload works at the end, no further steps have to be taken and the copy of
``odk/instances`` can be archived.

Where's the data now?
=====================
ODK Collect uploads data to the specified ODK Central clearinghouse.
The data is ingested daily into WAStD.

Once data is ingested into WAStD, it is visible and accessible to DBCA staff at
`https://wastd.dpaw.wa.gov.au/ <https://wastd.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_.
See chapter "Data consumers" for working examples.

The final analysis exports all data through the WAStD API using the R package
`etlTurtleNesting <https://github.com/dbca-wa/etlTurtleNesting>`_ and publishes
reports and data products to SharePoint.

Admin: Update forms
===================
From time to time the forms might be updated.
In this case, all data collection admins (and volunteers using their private devices) will be notified,
and each of their tablets need to run through the following steps:

* ODK Collect > Get blank form > (the new forms should already be selected, e.g. Track or Treat 0.36) > Get selected forms
* ODK Collect > Delete saved form > Blank forms > select the old form (e.g. Track or Treat 0.35) > delete
* Once all tablets are updated, notify the maintainer (Florian Mayer).
* Once all devices are updated, the old form version can be retired.

Admin: Form versions and change log
===================================
Always use the latest available version of a form.
Some older forms may be available for download - this is to allow import to WAStD.

Process to upgrade:

* Send all unsent saved forms
* Delete saved form > both Saved forms / Blank forms: Delete all
* Get blank form > get latest version of each form
