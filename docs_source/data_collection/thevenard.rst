Data Collection Management Thevenard and Delambre
======================================================

This section contains instructions for team leaders on managing data collection at Thevenard and Delambre Islands.

Start of trip
=============
* Star pickets at site boundaries with laminated printouts of instructions.
* Instructions: Username, Site Visit Start for site X, Site Visit End for Site Y. Go to Z.

Tablet brightness
=================
* Note: Tablets are set to automtically toggle dark mode and adaptive colour filter from sunset to sunrise. 
  This impacts the system menu and notifications but can be changes through the system settings.
* ODK Collect is set to follow the device theme, and therefore will toggle its own dark mode at night.
* Tablet theme display brightness can be adjusted from the system menu (swipe down twice from top edge).
* Find and record best combination of brightness/theme settings.

Morning walks
=============
* Map printout in office with locations of start and end points (star pickets).
* Thevenard: Three teams of 1-2: Thevenard North, Thevenard South, and Thevenard Tagging.
* Delambre: One team of 1-2.
* Equipment per team: 

  * Tablet in hand, neoprene pouch with length reference, writing board, whiteboard marker. 
  * Fly nets, water, sun protection. Sat phone for Thevenard North.
* Team Thevenard North: 

  * Walk to border Thevenard Tagging/North and start there with SVS.
  * SVS: Make sure Username is correct, take photo, capture point anywhere within correct site (here: Thevenard North).
  * Look for tracks/nests, dist/pred, marine wildlife incidents (strandings).
  * Cross out recorded tracks with a deep double line by shuffling your shoes through the sand.
  * Unknown species or nest: photo with length reference, then swipe back and enter best guess.
  * End at border Thevenard North/South at the roundabout where the car is parked.
  * Drive the car back to the accommodation.
* Team Thevenard South:

  * Drive the car from the accommodation to the roundabout at the border Thevenard South/North.
  * Start at the border with SVS, proceed with survey as written above.
  * End at border Thevenard South/Tagging with an SVE. Take photo backwards.
  * Walk to accommodation, ignore any tracks in Thevenard Tagging.
* Team Thevenard Tagging:

  * Walk from the accommodation to the border Thevenard South/Tagging. Ignore any tracks on the way there.
  * Start at the border with SVS, proceed East through the Tagging area with the survey as written above.
  * End at border Thevenard Tagging/North with SVS and walk back to accommodation.

* Team Delambre:
  
  * Depending on where the rake is stored, walk to the rake (north of camp or across the island) 
    and start there with an SVS.
  * Look for tracks/nests, dist/pred, marine wildlife incidents (strandings).
  * Cross out recorded tracks with a deep double line by shuffling your shoes through the sand.
  * Unknown species or nest: photo with length reference, then swipe back and enter best guess.
  * Finish at the other end of the tagging area with an SVE and leave the rake there.

* On return, the team leader receives tablets, ``Send Finalized forms``, plug into chargers.

Night tagging
=============
* Team leader hands out devices and verifies that Username is set correctly.
* Team leader (and no one else) starts night tagging session with an SVS. 
  Entering Team names is nice to have, but not essential.
* Aim to use Hybrid mode, so we have datasheets with PIT stickers to back up hand-entered data.
* In waiting periods, backfill paper datasheets but skip the datasheet photo.

Morning after night tagging
===========================
* Backfill remaining paper datasheets. Spread the data entry across literate, awake, and willing volunteers.
* Consult the Turtle Tag Explorer, a Google Sheet on one of the tablets, for the history of any flipper tag of interest.
* Once data is backfilled and all datasheets are photographed into the respective Turtle Tagging forms, ``Send Finalized Forms``.
* If any upload errors pop up, take a photo of the errors and WhatsApp to Florian.
* Notify Florian via WhatsApp that data upload is complete.

End of trip
===========
* Charge tablets, phone, and WiFi hotspot to 100% and turn off.
* Pack the flight case as received and notify Florian on mode of transport and expected arrival time of the flight case in Perth.
